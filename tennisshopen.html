      From slow download time, information overload and product
      oriented dinosaurs, e-commerce sites have developed greatly 
      in the last decade.
      <br><br> 
      To user friendly, accessible and swift layers of integrated 
      systems that gives customers a smooth shopping experience.

      So how does one set out to redesign a e-commerce site?
      <br><br>
        In a quick school project, I and a team of additional 3 students 
        set out to redesign the local Gothenburg company site and dito e-commerce 
        site tennishopen.se ("The Tennis Shop").
        <br><br>
        The aim was to improve the site with the user/customer in mind. No user data was supplied.
      </article>
      <article>
        My role - besides taking part in all parts of 
        the redesign - became that of considering the business impact of the 
        redesign, and suggesting to alter the brand.

        Tennisshopen was founded in 1976 in Gothenburg and has over the years grown from a physical store 
        only to offering its customers an online store with clothes and accessories for tennis and padel.<br><br> 
        The founders and individuals associated with the company are experts in tennis, many with a professional player background.
      </article>
      <article>
        Analysing the web content, Instagram and Facebook flows as well as reviews on Google indicates that 
        customers consider the expertise and high service level to be one reason they shop at Tennishopen.<br><br>
        The above image is, however, not apparent on the site today. The visuals, tonality and pricing could easily be confused 
        with a low-end, price-only focused competing e-commerce site. There is a shortage in user focus and an inconsequent 
        navigation structure.

        Before digging into ideation and design, we wanted to test<br>
        some user scenarios to examine how one of us would rate the<br> 
        user experience of the site. We stated four user stories and<br>
        used the desired action as a scenario to execute on the site as<br>
        it looks today.

        The conclusion of the primary research and short user experiance tests 
        indicate that there are elements that Tennishopen would gain from redesigning.
        Even more so, it indicates that tennishopen.se might gain from a rebranding of 
        the company by positioning it as a high-end, expert and service oriented business.</article>
      <article class="col-6">

        <b>High-end visual/brand identity</b>
        <br>
        The change in visual impression is more true to the core of Tennisshopen´s value 
        proposition and target groups.
        <br><br>
        This will probably increase the appeal to high-spending customers (that is a 
        large proportion of the target groups in tennis). It also alignes with their 
        professionality of service.

        <b>Simplified navigation</b>
        <br>
        The navigation is unecessary complex, risking high bounce rate and low conversion rate.
        Simplifyng navigation will shorten amount of clicks, minimize bounce rate and 
        improve the overall user experience of the site.
        <br><br>
        For Tenisshopen, this adds customer value. Easier adaptation for new visitors 
        lessens and existing customers experience improves, increasing retainment.</article>

        Tennishopen is a high-end e-commerce site with profound expertise and a 
        high degree of service level. They should leverage their competitive advantages.
        <br><br>
        One way is to storify the about us-text and place it more centrally than just a 
        short text in the footer. This will emphasize that Tennishopen are experts in both 
        tennis and customer satisfaction.</article>

        <b>Adjust the copy & lenght of parapgraphs</b><br>
        The paragraph vertical length and the amount of textual information renders an 
        information overflow for the user. Paragraphs should be shortened vertically, 
        ideally by using subheaders as links that - when clicking/hovering - reveals 
        additional info.
        <br><br>
        The copy can be concentrated. For instance, the use of “tennis-” prior to articles 
        or subsites can be deleted. The visitors presumes that shoes sold here are tennis 
        shoes, for example.

      E-commerce is an extremely complex mix of several systems that have to

     <b>Branding and design</b><br>
      We early discovered that we needed to suggest not just a redesign but also
